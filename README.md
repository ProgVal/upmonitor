# upmonitor

## What is it?

Monitoring without any central point. It does *not* work yet.

Configuration synchronisation is easy since all hosts use the exact
same settings file.

##Â How to use

See `settings.example.json`. There will be no other doc about the
configuration file until upmonitor works.

## How does it work?

Read the code. No other doc for the moment.

You may also want to build the Sphinx documentation from the `docs/` folder
if you want something more readable (actually, it is generated from
docstrings in the code).
